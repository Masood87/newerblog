<p>One of the coolest things I have learned in R recently is creating a website with <strong>blogdown</strong> package. The <strong>blogdown</strong> websites are created and maintained from within R mostly, which is the best part about it if you are a R user. There are many sources that provide details and reasons for using <strong>blogdown</strong>, so I will not dwell on that. Instead, I am going to provide a <em>brief and to-the-point</em> tutorial on how to start your website with R and <strong>blogdown</strong>.</p>

<h2>1. Create a repository on github</h2>
<p><em>Check my earlier blog on <a href="/2018/05/18/basics-of-github-through-command-line/">basics of github</a></em>. If you do not have a github account, visit <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> and create an account (it is free!). Once you have an account, create a repository and call it <strong>myblog</strong>. Creating the repository, also known as <em>repo</em>, copy that repository’s url. The url should look like this: <code>https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git</code></p>

<div id="clone-git-repository" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Clone git repository</h2>
<p>The github repository link is used to clone that repo on a directory in your computer. Cloning a repo essentially means copying repo in the local computer. To clone the github repo, you have t use <strong>Terminal</strong> if you are on a Mac and <strong>Command Prompt</strong> if you are on windows, and install git if you are on windows. There are other applications, but Mac’s <strong>Terminal</strong> and windows’ <strong>Command Prompt</strong> are default and does not require downloading.</p>
