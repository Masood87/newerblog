Exploring relationship among variables in a data set is never easier with **corrplot** package and function of the same name. **corrplot** takes in a correlation matrix and returns a visual representation of that correlation matrix.

Try it for yourself. 

1. Install and load **corrplot** package

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
```
