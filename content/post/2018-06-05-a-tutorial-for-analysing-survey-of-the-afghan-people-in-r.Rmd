## 1 About the Survey of the Afghan People

Since 2006, The Asia Foundation conducts [_**the Survey of the Afghan People**_](https://asiafoundation.org/where-we-work/afghanistan/survey/), a nationally-representative annual survey. The Survey reflects perceptions about a broad range of topics including security, development, governance, service delivery, womenâ€™s rights, and migration. The Survey is broadly used by policy makers, academics, non-governmental organizations working in and on Afghanistan. The Foundation make the Survey's data public on its [website](https://asiafoundation.org/where-we-work/afghanistan/survey/download-data-form/).
