```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(twitteR)

api_key <- "Xt0oXgKSo6LdrDGoXaWr50CYw"
api_secret <- "rdjVhLuwYY9VKKU2NAIU5WGM8QKUaALZ6pMiA0tdhin6i3j5F4"
access_token <- "987749453288394753-cvmDm0t3MhOOEw4PFmDFRqjcvwnSrag"
access_secret <- "8G344YbekypsnXLgKNqGBc7Vx88b5JbLFxHcdf8AZOg5a"
```

In this post I am going to download tweets using **twitteR** package.

1. To being, you have to have a twitter account. If you do not have, create a twitter account on [twitter.com](https://twitter.com).

2. Create a twitter application on [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com). There, you have to insert a number of information, see the following screen shot.

3. Once, you created an application, you will have access to _API Key_ and _API Secret_ in the **Keys and Access Tokens** tab. In the same tab, you can create _access tokens_ too. Store these information in R, but before that you have to do the step 4.

4. Go to RStudio: install and attach **twitteR** package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("twitteR")
library(twitteR)
```

4. From step 3, store **API Key**, **API Secret**, **Access Token**, and **Access Secret** into the following code chunk.

```{r eval=FALSE}
api_key <- "YOUR_API_KEY"
api_secret <- "YOUR_API_SECRET"
access_token <- "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
access_secret <- "YOUR_ACCESS_SECRET"
```

5. Now, setup your twitter details with **twitteR**

```{r}
setup_twitter_oauth(consumer_key = api_key, 
                    consumer_secret = api_secret, 
                    access_token=access_token, 
                    access_secret=access_secret)
```

6. Collect tweets of your interest. For example, I want to collect 500 tweets that used **#Afghanistan**. That simple!

```{r}
tw_afghanistan <- searchTwitteR(searchString = "#Afghanistan", n = 500)
```

At this stage, you will have the tweets in the form of a list. You can do any operation that is applicable on lists and character format. For starters, you can print the first tweet.

```{r}
tw_afghanistan[[1]]
```

In the next post, I will explore other packages related to **twitter** and also write about how to do analysis and visualize twitter data.
