<h2>A Meaningful Relationship</h2>
<p>There seems to be a relatinship between weight (<code>wt</code>) and mileage (<code>mpg</code>) from the <strong>mtcars</strong> based on observing them on a scatter plot–perhaps a negative one.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-06-14-hypothesis-testing-with-r_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Fit a linear model to estimate the relationship between weight and mpg, and tidy the output. Looking at the statistics and p-value, I can reject the null hypothesis (no relationship).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(broom)
library(dplyr)
tidy(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##          term  estimate std.error statistic      p.value
## 1 (Intercept) 37.285126  1.877627 19.857575 8.241799e-19
## 2          wt -5.344472  0.559101 -9.559044 1.293959e-10</code></pre>
<p>Normally, the above estimation would suffice to answer a hypothesis question. For education, let’s create a null (no relationship) distribution of slopes using <strong>infer</strong> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># install.packages(&quot;infer&quot;)
library(infer)
perm_slopes &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%
  specify(formula = mpg ~ wt) %&gt;% # specify the linear model
  hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;% # provide null hypothesis that two variables are independent
  generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) %&gt;% # describe how to generate the sampling distribution
  calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) # calculate the statistic of interest

obs_slope &lt;- tidy(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)) %&gt;% .[2,2] # observed slope</code></pre>
<p>Then, plot the permuted slopes using a histogram and add the observed slope as a vertical line. I can see the observed slope does not overlap even one of the 1000 permuted slopes, which is a visual way of finding that probability of observing null hypothesis is less than 0.1%. This means, I can reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(perm_slopes, aes(stat)) + geom_histogram() + # histogram distribution of slope of null hypothesis
  geom_vline(xintercept = obs_slope, color = &quot;red&quot;) # add a vertical line for observed slope</code></pre>

<div id="a-not-meaningful-relationship" class="section level2">
<h2>A Not-Meaningful Relationship</h2>
<p>To contrast, let’s look at the relationship between real axle ratio (<code>drat</code>) and “1/4 mile time” (<code>qsec</code>) from the same <strong>mtcars</strong> data, which appears to have no relationship based on observing them on a scatter plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(mtcars, aes(drat, qsec)) + geom_point()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-06-14-hypothesis-testing-with-r_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Fitting a linear model to estimate the linear relationship between <code>drat</code> and <code>qsec</code>, I cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is a meaningful relationship between the two variables. Note the statistics and p-value values.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy(lm(qsec ~ drat, data = mtcars))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##          term   estimate std.error statistic      p.value
## 1 (Intercept) 16.7524663 2.2086713 7.5848617 1.855757e-08
## 2        drat  0.3048143 0.6076358 0.5016398 6.195826e-01</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>obs_slope &lt;- tidy(lm(qsec ~ drat, data = mtcars)) %&gt;% .[2,2]</code></pre>
<p>Let’s estimate the null (no relationship) distribution using the <strong>infer</strong> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>perm_slopes &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%
  specify(qsec ~ drat) %&gt;%
  hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) %&gt;%
  calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Next, I am going to use the permuted slops to plot a histogram, and add a red vertical line that represents the observed slope of relationship between <code>qsec</code> and <code>drat</code>. I can see that the observed slope overlaps the permuted slopes (null distribution), and once again I come to the same conclusionthat there is no meaningful relationship between <code>qsec</code> and <code>drat</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># ggplot(perm_slopes, aes(stat)) + geom_histogram() +
#   geom_vline(xintercept = obs_slope, color = &quot;red&quot;)</code></pre>
