      <description>A Meaningful Relationship There seems to be a relatinship between weight (wt) and mileage (mpg) from the mtcars based on observing them on a scatter plot–perhaps a negative one.
library(ggplot2) ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point() Fit a linear model to estimate the relationship between weight and mpg, and tidy the output. Looking at the statistics and p-value, I can reject the null hypothesis (no relationship).
library(broom) library(dplyr) # tidy(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars))  </description>

      <description>Estimating linear regression Before starting, I am going to load a number of utility libraries for this session.
library(tidyverse) library(broom) library(plotly) A simple linear regression using mtcars dataset. I want to look at how weight of a car is associated with how many miles a car travels per gallon of gasoline–an indicator of fuel economy. I am going to look at their summary and scatter plot. For scatter plot, I use base-R’s plot() function.</description>
