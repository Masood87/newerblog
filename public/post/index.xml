      <description>In this post I am going to download tweets using twitteR package.
To being, you have to have a twitter account. If you do not have, create a twitter account on twitter.com.
 Create a twitter application on apps.twitter.com. There, you have to insert a number of information, see the following screen shot.
  3. Once, you created an application, you will have access to API Key and API Secret in the Keys and Access Tokens tab.</description>

      <title>Explore Correlation Among Variables with Corrplot</title>

      <description>Exploring relationship among variables in a data set is never easier with corrplot package and function of the same name. corrplot takes in a correlation matrix and returns a visual representation of that correlation matrix.
Try it for yourself.
Install and load corrplot package  install.packages(&amp;quot;corrplot&amp;quot;) library(corrplot) Estimate correlation between all variables of mtcars dataset using cor, and then plot the correlations using corrplot(). You have to specify a method, and there are quite a few of them–here I demonstrate two of them: square and number  mat &amp;lt;- cor(mtcars) corrplot(mat, method = &amp;quot;square&amp;quot;) corrplot(mat, method = &amp;quot;number&amp;quot;) To explore more, see the help (?</description>

      <description>Did you know you can upload almost anything on Github.com?
Recently, I have started uploading many of my files on github, besides code. I do it because I am working on two different computers, one at work and one at home, and I think this is a great way to keep my work synchronized. I am not going to talk more about using github at this point–maybe I will have a dedicated post on that later.</description>

      <description>Estimating linear regression Before starting, I am going to load a number of utility libraries for this session.
library(tidyverse) library(broom) library(plotly) A simple linear regression using mtcars dataset. I want to look at how weight of a car is associated with how many miles a car travels per gallon of gasoline–an indicator of fuel economy. I am going to look at their summary and scatter plot. For scatter plot, I use base-R’s plot() function.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Asia Foundation (TAF) employs a number of methods to ensure data quality for the Survey of the Afghan People (SAP). The most important quality controls are (1) third party monitoringy, and (2) logic tests. The third party monitoring is carried out on 10% of all surveys by an independent company, and 25% are subject to monitoring from the data collection company. The third party monitoring started in 2014, and since then Sayara Research has been the implementing partner for this activity.</description>

      <description>One of the coolest things I have learned in R recently is creating a website with blogdown package. The blogdown websites are created and maintained from within R mostly, which is the best part about it if you are a R user. There are many sources that provide details and reasons for using blogdown, so I will not dwell on that. Instead, I am going to provide a brief and to-the-point tutorial on how to start your website with R and blogdown.</description>

      <title>Plot Missing Values</title>
      <link>/2018/05/plot-missing-values/</link>

      <guid>/2018/05/plot-missing-values/</guid>
      <description>In this post, we will explore visdat package to visualize missing values. Then, we will recreate a similar plot using ggplot2 package. Next, using the ggplot2 method, we will visualize other numeric or character values in a dataset. Finally, using the ggplot2 method, we will create a custom function that will plot any value in any dataset.
 There are many ways to inspect and find about missing values in a dataset.</description>

      <description>Create account and repository on github.com Go to github.com and create an account. Once, account is created, create a repository in Repositories tab and click on the green button New. The following page opens.
 NOTE: A repository is something like a project folder.
   Copy repository URL After a new repository is created, copy the clone url link. This link is used to clone the repository from server to the computer.</description>
