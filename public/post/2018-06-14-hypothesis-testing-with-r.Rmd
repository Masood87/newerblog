## A Meaningful Relationship

There seems to be a relatinship between weight (`wt`) and mileage (`mpg`) from the **mtcars** based on observing them on a scatter plot--perhaps a negative one.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point()
```

Fit a linear model to estimate the relationship between weight and mpg, and tidy the output. Looking at the statistics and p-value, I can reject the null hypothesis (no relationship).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(broom)
library(dplyr)
tidy(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars))
```
