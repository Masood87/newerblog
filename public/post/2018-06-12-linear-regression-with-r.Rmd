# Estimating linear regression

Before starting, I am going to load a number of utility libraries for this session.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(plotly)
```

A simple linear regression using **mtcars** dataset. I want to look at how weight of a car is associated with how many miles a car travels per gallon of gasoline--an indicator of fuel economy. I am going to look at their summary and scatter plot. For scatter plot, I use base-R's `plot()` function.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(mtcars[, c("wt", "mpg")])
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
```
