      <description>Did you know you can upload almost anything on Github.com?
Recently, I have started uploading many of my files on github, besides code. I do it because I am working on two different computers, one at work and one at home, and I think this is a great way to keep my work synchronized. I am not going to talk more about using github at this pointâ€“maybe I will have a dedicated post on that later.</description>

      <description>Create account and repository on github.com Go to github.com and create an account. Once, account is created, create a repository in Repositories tab and click on the green button New. The following page opens.
 NOTE: A repository is something like a project folder.
   Copy repository URL After a new repository is created, copy the clone url link. This link is used to clone the repository from server to the computer.</description>
